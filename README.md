# RegenData
RegenData is a source for data and analytics related to Gitcoin Grants. It can be used to uncover insights on mechanisms such as quadratic funding or to identify sybil accounts. 

It makes data from the [Grants Stack Indexer](https://github.com/gitcoinco/grants-stack-indexer) SQL-queryable and also makes available onchain and offchain data from other sources, including, [Passport](https://passport.xyz/), pre-Indexer Gitcoin Grants, Allo Data from Dune, and datasets we manually manage in Google Sheets.
