# Project Overview

Welcome to RegenData's documentation folder. This repository is structured to help you quickly navigate and understand each part of the system. It's suggested that you start with the quickstart guide in the main [README.md](../README.md) file then come back to these docs. There are also some loom videos for internal reference you can ask a teammate for. 

Below is a quick overview of the key docs:

- [Architecture.md](./Architecture.md): Get an overview of the projectâ€™s structure and data flow.
- [Automations.md](./Automations.md): Learn about the automation scripts that keep the system running smoothly.
    - [MaterializedViewsRefresh.md](./MaterializedViewsRefresh.md): Learn about the main script that refreshes our materialized views.
    - [ForeignSchemaRefresh.md](./ForeignSchemaRefresh.md): Learn about the main script that refreshes our foreign schema.
- [Troubleshooting.md](./Troubleshooting.md): Covers common errors and solutions (including server reboots).


This docs folder should have everything you need to keep the project running smoothly.
